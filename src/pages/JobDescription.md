---

##  About the Role

We are looking for a Tech Principal (In-House Systems) responsible for building browser-based web apps, including anything from back-end services to the front-end web and UI. Your primary responsibilities will be to design and develop these applications, and to coordinate with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, a commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and quality product is essential. 

This is a hands-on lead role in a two-person technology team. You will be the primary architect and developer for custom, in-house software that directly supports our underwriting and operations teams. We build tools that let our business move faster and smarter than our competitors.

##  Primary Responsibilities

- Lead the design and development of in-house applications primarily using C# and the .NET ecosystem.
- Develop easy to use Web solutions that are visually appealing to support insurance document creation, processing, and reporting.
- Design, build, and maintain efficient, reusable, and reliable C# code.
- Design efficient and scalable database structures to support our online applications.
- Work directly with management and internal stakeholders to translate business needs into clear, practical system designs.
- Write test plans and record results.
- Provide site demos and training to internal team members.
- Provide management with regular communication on the progress of projects and other initiatives.
- Own the technical direction, architecture, and long-term maintainability of in-house applications.
- Rapidly prototype, iterate, and improve tools used daily by underwriting and operations teams.
- Balance speed and quality—knowing when “good enough today” beats “perfect next quarter.”
- Make pragmatic technology choices across a wide stack, based on business need rather than trend.
- Design, implement, and maintain cloud workflows and assets (primarily in Azure) to support scalable, reliable internal systems.
- Act as the technical lead and thought partner to business stakeholders, not just an implementer
